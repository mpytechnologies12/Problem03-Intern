DEVOPS INTERN - PROBLEM STATEMENT 03


- [ ] Develop a CI/CD pipeline for a .NET Core project comprising multiple microservices using Jenkins and open-source tools. The .NET Core application source code files are stored in a local directory, and the pipeline will utilize self-hosted Docker images without pushing them to an external Docker registry. The objective is to set up a comprehensive CI/CD process that automates building, testing, and deploying the microservices while ensuring the system's integrity and performance. The pipeline should incorporate steps for code compilation, unit testing, containerization, integration testing, and deployment to a self-hosted environment, leveraging Jenkins for orchestration and management of the entire workflow.
